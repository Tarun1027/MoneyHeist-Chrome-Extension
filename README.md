This extension will save you from reading any Money-Hesit Spoilers as well as visual images. 

This extension is developed by **Tarun**.

I am not an expert with Google Chrome Development and this is my first extension made ever.

- **Image Blurring**: Blurs the neighbouring Images which are relevant and might reveal the Spoiler information.
- **Simple, BugLess and Easy**: If there's a bug, it's a feature.
