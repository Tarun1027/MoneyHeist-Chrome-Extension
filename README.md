This extension will save you from reading any Money-Heistt Spoilers as well as visual images. 

This extension is developed by **Tarun**.

I am not an expert with Google Chrome Development and this is my first extension made ever. 



# Features
- **Spoiler Blocking**: Searches entire web page and replaces Spoilers with text `##[TEXT BLOCKED: SPOILER DETECTED]`
- **Image Blurring**: Blurs the neighbouring Images which are relevant and might reveal the Spoiler information.
